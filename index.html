                <p>Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, but learning to dance in the rain.  I suppose you could say that I have worn many hats throughout my career.  I've worked at a Record Label, was an International Flight Attendant, and currently work at a Health Insurance company.  However, the one thing that keeps me motivated, energized, and grounded is a strong sense of who I am.  
                </p>

                <p>A creative soul by nature, I have always gravitated towards artwork, music, and unique beauty.  Pair that with my inner nerd (a deep unwavering love of all things tech), and I'm hoping to come out of this bootcamp as one amazing Full Stack Developer.
